# GroupArgument
This is most definitely *not* a free open-sourced program that allows one to play a version of the t.v. show hosted by Steve Harvey (Family Fued) for free at home

# TODO ( No particular order of importance  / implementation)
1) Player names should be an argument
2) Arg parsing should allow specific games in the database to be played
3) Unit tests would be nice
4) GM Window needs to be classified (rather than just a bunch of random stuff as a script)
5) GM Window should allow for a multiplier for rounds
6) GM Window should allow for multiple rounds w/o being restarted
7) Game window should .... work
8) Game window should be tied into GM Window such that all values are reflected and 
    updated in real time
9) GM Window should allow for a parameter of new Q/A
