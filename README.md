# GroupArgument
This is most definitely *not* a free open-sourced program that allows one to play a version of the t.v. show hosted by Steve Harvey (Family Fued) for free at home

# TODO ( No particular order of importance  / implementation)
*) Arg parsing should allow specific games in the database to be played
*) Unit tests would be nice
*) GM Window should allow for a multiplier for rounds
*) GM Window should allow for multiple rounds w/o being restarted
*) Game window should .... work
*) Game window should be tied into GM Window such that all values are reflected and 
    updated in real time
*) GM Window should allow for a parameter of new Q/A (needs to be tested)
