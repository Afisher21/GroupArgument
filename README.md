# GroupArgument
This is most definitely *not* a free open-sourced program that allows one to play a version of the t.v. show hosted by Steve Harvey (Family Fued) for free at home

# TODO ( No particular order of importance  / implementation)
*) Arg parsing should allow specific games in the database to be played
*) Unit tests would be nice
*) Game window should .... work
*) Game window should be tied into GM Window such that all values are reflected and 
    updated in real time
*) Should scrape more questions for the database

# To test
*) new q/a from cli params
*) import db file from cli params


# Known bugs
*) Something with the "next round" button causes an issue if the next round has fewer answers than the previous. Should be easy enough to find & fix
